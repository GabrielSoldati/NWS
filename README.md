# Networking Scanner Project

## Project Idea

The goal of this project is to develop a basic networking scanner tool. This tool will allow users to scan and identify devices connected to a network and gather essential information about these devices.

## Features

- **IP Range Scanning:** Provide users the ability to specify an IP address range to scan for connected devices.
- **Ping Sweep:** Implement a ping sweep feature to quickly identify live hosts on the network.
- **Basic Port Scanning:** Scan target devices for common open ports, such as HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), FTP (21), and SSH (22).
- **Basic Service Detection:** Identify basic services running on the target devices based on the open ports found.
- **Scan Results Export:** Export the scan results to a simple text file for further analysis or reporting.

Edit: Whilst working on project Scan Results Export was removed due to switching over to a gui solution, rendering it redundant.
Same thing for the Ping Sweep
